A simplistic first-person maze.

## Implementation
Which features I included:

- Constructive Solid Geometry
- At least one object to pick up or interact with (key)
- At least one enemy to impede progress
- A main menu, an in-game menu, a death screen, and an end-game screen
- Music and sound effects
- The ability to re-map (and save) keyboard controls
- 3D in-game text to instruct the player on the objective, and to mark the "door"
